# 3×1 Demonstrator: Solar, wind and water harvesting in a single educational project

The 'Edudemos' project launches an innovative 3×1 demonstrator that combines three powerful educational resources in a single device. This multifunctional demonstrator allows students to explore and experiment with solar energy harvesting, wind energy, and water harvesting, all in a single project.

The 3×1 demonstrator is designed for students in vocational training centers and schools to build with the help of their teachers, integrating fundamental concepts of renewable energy and resource management.
